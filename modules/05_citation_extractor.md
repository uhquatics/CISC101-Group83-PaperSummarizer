# Module 5: Citation Extractor

## Purpose
Extract citations from the paper text and ensure they appear in summaries.

## Workflow
1. Scan each section for citations.
2. Extract citation markers (e.g., [1], (Smith, 2020)).
3. Verify citations are included in section summaries.
4. Flag missing citations if referenced but not present in text.

## Constraints
- No invented citations.
- Only use citations present in the paper.
